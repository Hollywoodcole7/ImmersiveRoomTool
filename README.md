# ImmersiveRoomTool
My approach to achieve a 5-wall projection mapped interactive installation using Ureal Engine, Max MSP, and VDMX.
I tried to breakdown what is absolutely necessary to make this work in the most barebones sense so that others might be able to accomplish this process and use it for A360 Studio in Brooklyn or in your own set up.

The Max patch is the bridge I used to compile the video sources in Unreal engine to transfer over TCP Spout to TCP Syphon. Feel Free to adapt it to your needs.

Make sure to read the technical documentation for step by step and screenshots of the process.
